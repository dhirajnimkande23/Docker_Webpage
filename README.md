## üì¶ Commands Breakdown: Git & File Management

---

### 1. **Clone a GitHub Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhirajnimkande23/Docker_Webpage.git
```

* Downloads the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
* The directory `Docker_Webpage` is created with all repo contents.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Start working with a remote project locally.

---

### 2. **Change Directory into Cloned Repo**

```bash
cd Docker_Webpage/
```

* Navigates into the cloned project directory.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Start working inside your cloned repository.

---

### 3. **Move Files into a Subdirectory**

```bash
mv Dockerfile nano.tar.gz Docker_Webpage/
```

* Moves `Dockerfile` and `nano.tar.gz` into a subdirectory called `Docker_Webpage/`.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Organize project files inside a specific folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If `Docker_Webpage/` is already your current directory, and there's a subfolder also named `Docker_Webpage/`, this can cause confusion. Double-check the folder structure.

---

### 4. **Change Directory Again**

```bash
cd Docker_Webpage/
```

* Moves into the inner `Docker_Webpage/` directory (if this exists).

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Continue working from within the new directory where files were moved.

---

### 5. **Check Git Status**

```bash
git status
```

* Shows the current state of the working directory:

  * Untracked files
  * Changes staged for commit
  * Changes not staged

‚úÖ **Purpose**: See what changes have been made or need to be committed.

---

### 6. **Stage a File for Commit**

```bash
git add Dockerfile
```

* Stages the `Dockerfile` to be committed.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Tells Git to include this file in the next commit.

---

### 7. **Commit with a Message**

```bash
git commit Dockerfile -m "apache2 dockerfile"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This command is **incorrectly structured**.

* The correct format should be:

```bash
git commit -m "apache2 dockerfile"
```

* If you‚Äôve already used `git add Dockerfile`, Git knows what to commit.
* `Dockerfile` should **not** be placed between `commit` and `-m`.

‚úÖ **Fix**:
Use:

```bash
git commit -m "apache2 dockerfile"
```

---

### 8. **Stage Multiple Files**

```bash
git add Dockerfile nano.tar.gz
```

* Stages both files for commit.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Prepare both files to be saved in Git history.

---

### 9. **Check Git Status Again**

```bash
git status
```

* Verifies that both files are staged and ready for commit.

---

### 10. **Commit All Staged Files**

```bash
git commit -m "webpage"
```

* Commits the staged changes with the message `"webpage"`.

‚úÖ **Purpose**: Save your changes to the local Git history.

---

### 11. **Push Changes to GitHub**

```bash
git push origin main
```

* Pushes your commits to the remote `origin` (i.e., GitHub).
* Sends them to the `main` branch.
